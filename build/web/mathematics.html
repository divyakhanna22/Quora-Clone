<b><p class = "maths">What is the best math trick you have ever learned?</b></p>
<p>Reverse your percentage calculations.

Without using a calculator, please tell me, how much is 8 % of 50?

You’re probably thinking, hmm, I know for a fact that 10 % is 5. So 8 % must be a little less. Probably around 4–4.5 something. Definitely not an integer, because 50 and 8 are not divisible. Lets go with 4.333 because… because…

It’s exactly 4.

I didn’t use my calculator.

Instead, I reversed the calculation. Because 8 % of 50 is the same as 50 % of 8. Which (for most people) is a much more simple calculation to make in your head.

It holds true for all numbers. Go ahead, try a few.

4 % of 75?

80 % of 50?

30 % of 25?

In some cases it greatly simplifies the calculation or makes it easier to approximate the result.

Edit 1: True, with some numbers you’re screwed either way. For example, 73.1 % of 634.5. There is a reason the calculator was invented :)

Edit 2: Yes, it works with numbers greater than 100. For example, 5 % of 2000 is the same as 2000 % of 5 (20 x 5).

Edit 3: Some suggest a similar “trick” (which is actually just the traditional textbook formula for calculating percent): Multiply the numbers and divide by 100. For example 6 % of 70. First, you multiply. 6 x 70 = 420. Then divide by 100, which equals 4.2. This of course also holds true the other way around (70 % of 6) as per my original trick. The point of my trick is that sometimes the reverse calculation is easier to perform on the spot - for some people that is. If you don’t have that problem, fine, but please stop telling me.</p>

<b><p class = "maths">How did Shakuntala Devi mentally calculate the 23rd root of a 201-digit number correctly?</b></p>
<p>Devi was a very talented mental calculator, but by no means the extreme prodigy that she has been made out to be in the media, and she certainly couldn't take the 23rd root of a number "faster than a computer".

She was an accomplished showman - she grew up traveling with her father and giving performances, and when her father got too old, she travelled by herself and sent money to her family. The modern field of mental calculators generally shies away from words like "prodigy" or "genius". Mental calculation is obviously related to mathematics, but many of the historically great mental calculators were not particularly knowledgeable in mathematics per se.

By calling her an "accomplished showman", I don't mean to denigrate her at all, quite to the contrary. It's an intricate, and old, art form, dating at least to the 1700s, more akin to the work of an illusionist than that of a professor in mathematics. It takes hard work and dedication to be a good illusionist of any sort. Devi was born, and performed, in a simpler era, one before the internet and computers that have deconstructed much of the "magic" of these artists. And her story in particular - as a poor child traveling in India, earning a living for her family with her demonstrations - holds a deep appeal to us. Especially since, by all accounts I've read of those who met her, she was a very special person.

(If you want a demonstration of the "powerful magic" of mental calculation, just search the internet for the tricks involved in solving 3rd roots and 5th roots of large integers in your head. You will astonish your friends and family by just a little effort of rote memorization.)

There are a few things you first have to know about mental calculations of this sort. They are mostly related to memorization and pattern matching, and putting various significant constraints on the problems being asked. If you are not versed in the arts, some tricks that appear very difficult are in fact quite simple. That, after all, is the general art of illusion.

Today, this art form is called "mathemagic", and notable "mathemagicians" include Martin Gardner, Arthur T Benjamin, Raymond Smullyan, and Persi Diaconis.

<b><p class = "maths">What was the very first mathematical fact you learned that blew your mind?</b></p>
<p>What if I told you you could NEVER accurately calculate its coastline ?

Sounds crazy, right? I mean, it is a finite island, and therefore MUST have a finite coastline...

Well, that’s not the case. This is called the classic Coastline paradox, which basically boils down to this.

“You can never accurately measure any coastlines because of their convoluted nature - depending on your measurement scales, you end up with different values.”

Coastlines are a typical example of fractals, a mathematical self-similar, infinitely recursive set where the concept of length scales (as is used in Euclidean geometry / space) is invalid.

Fractals may be thought of as self-similar figures that have a finite area but an infinite perimeter.</p>

<b><p class = "maths">What is the most useful piece of advanced mathematics you can teach me in a single answer?</b></p>
<p>In my opinion, the best part about advanced mathematics is that it lets you think about ‘simple’ things on a higher level. By abstract reasoning, one can gather refreshing insights about well-understood topics. Allow me to give an example.

How would you define what a circle is? Given some time, you would probably come up with the following definition:

A circle is the set of points at a given distance (the radius) from a fixed point (the center). However, this is implicitly assuming a certain definition of 'distance'. Indeed, the distance used is called the “Euclidean distance”, the length of the straight line connecting two points. As you can see, the set of points at a given distance from a fixed point is now given by a (tilted) square. By our definition of circle, the square is thus also a circle.
