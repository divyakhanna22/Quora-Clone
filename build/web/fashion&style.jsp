<b><p class = "fash">Is the shoe brand Skechers really that good?</p></b>
<p>It may be very popular brand in USA,but in India it's customer care service is very poor.

I bought a pair of shoes costed 5000/- INR . and just after one day I found that both shoes were not identical, left one was little bit longer. I contacted that retailer from where I had bought it. At first he just refuted to accept by giving so many examples. But at the end, he emailed to skechers customer care,as he said. After one week now he has denied from changing by saying that company has not accepted my complaint.

Actually, due to ankle problem on the suggestion of american YouTube doctor I tried this brand. But after using this, problem has increased little bit more.

So I would suggest, if you are thinking of shoes , this option may damage your foot and money both.

This is just a fraud company. I had bought that shoe from rohini sector 8 near metro station, worst service provider retailer.

Pics of retailer and shoes are enclosed.</p>

<b><p class = "fash">On which actress is the movie 'Fashion' by Madhur Bhandarkar based on?</b></p>
<p>The movie Fashion featuring Kangana Ranaut is based on the true and very sad story of model Gitanjali who descend rapidly from the glamour of the ramp to the extremely bad depths of drugs, alcohol and many. She was one of the top models appearing in the best of advertisements with brands like Lakme. She was a designer turned model who once walked the ramp with Miss Universe 1994, Sushmita Sen, in the 90’s & others of the same class. She fell in love with a guy and this news of relationship with the guy was even denied by her. After a long time they got married, had a son, turned herself down, tried to live on drugs and is now, struggling to come back to life. She has turned herself almost into a junkie and doesn’t know about things happening around her. If she is asked about fashion, it sounds like nuclear fission to her, Life appears as Lie to her.</p>

<b><p class = "fash">What is the most expensive item you've ever bought?</b></p>
<p>A pair of Air Jordans!

I don't regret buying them at all. I got them from the Nike official store for almost 11k. That's a lot for a pair of shoes plus I'm a student and 11k means a lot to me! So, I got these from my savings (I don't remember how long I did.). Finally I got the Retro Air Jordan 1's “Royal Blue”. Apart from this, I own a Nikon D5600 (18–140mm) which my Dad gifted me!

Life's short. And you gotta own a pair of Jordans atleast once! Let them all stare.</p>
