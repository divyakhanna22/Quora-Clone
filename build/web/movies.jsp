<b><p class = "mov">What are some unknown facts about Bollywood actresses?</b></p>
<p>1. When Kareena and Ranbir came together for the fifth season of Koffee with Karan, Kareena said she wanted to dance on Katrina's item songs at their wedding. Kareena's exact words on the show were: "I hope I get an opportunity to dance to Chikni Chameli and Sheila ki jawaani at Ranbir and Katrina's wedding!" This big sister definitely lead her young brother to a lot of unwanted questions!</p>
<p>2. Shah Rukh did not spare cricketer Virat Kohli at the IPL 7 opening ceremony. The actor staged a mock 'swayamvar' for the team India vice-captain. He was asked to select his potential bride and of all the choices, he chose Anushka Sharma. SRK also made him wear the actress's photo around his neck. Needless to say, Virat turned red in the face. The couple declared that they were indeed in a relationship later.</p>
<p>3. Did you know Aamir Khan allegedly has a love child with Bollywood writer Jessica Hines who he had met during the shoot of Vikram Bhatt's Ghulam. While Aamir has denied any possibility of a love child, Hines has been pretty vocal about it. She once said in an interview that when their son grows up, she would tell him that his father didn't like them! Though it makes us wonder if anyone can make such tall claims without an ounce of truth in it!</p>
<p>4. Not many people know that Bollywood superstar, Hrithik Roshan has hired a personal life coach after his divorce with Suzanne Khan. Hrithik Roshan felt the need of someone professional to get over his messy divorce. The life coach's job is to help Hrithik Roshan stay upbeat and focused about his work, and forget about his divorce with Suzanne Khan.</p>
<p>5. The striking resemblance of Sonakshi's face with Reena Roy gave rise to the rumour that made many people believe that Sonakshi Sinha is in fact Reena Roy's daughter and not Poonam Sinha's.</p>

<b><p class = "mov">Do Indian actresses feel any kind of emotional attachment with their co-stars when they do intimate scenes?</b></p>
<p>I am married and a mom too. I have acted in few movies and have also done intimate consummation scenes. Although I haven’t done any nude or explicit sex scene, the scenes done by me involved significant exposing and intimacy. So I feel that I am right person to answer your question.

To start with, I would like to mention that barring some explicit sex scene or any nude scenes, no camera tricks or body doubles are used in intimate scenes. The actress herself has to do the intimate scenes. Intimate scenes are filmed very professionally. I mean that the ambience is very professional and kind of serious too. Like for instance, if the scene consists of actress to be in bra alone and so accordingly the actress gets ready and comes on the sets with bra alone then that’s not something which is considered with awe. Such a sight of lady is normal and usual experience for actor as well as for other crew members. So like some crew members won’t event stare at your arrival and will remain busy in their work. So the point is being exposed on sets is not a big deal for people there. They take it very professionally.

While acting out intimate scenes, there will definitely be some uncomfortable times. Like for instance, I recall that in a scene, the actor was to kiss my neck, cleavage and breasts passionately. We had to shoot this scene many times because every time he came close to me, that would really discomfit me. But gradually I managed the scene and we shot it successfully.

There is no emotional connection with co-star even if such scenes are shot multiple times. Because the focus there is acting according to prescribed script and not according to our conscience. This indirectly shifts attention towards acting perfectly according to script rather than getting our attention towards intimacy itself. However, depending upon personal level of comfort, one will definitely feel hard to tolerate intimate hug or kiss from a guy. Like I was fine with him kissing cleavage by it was extremely hard to tolerate his kissing of my breasts. But at end of the day, you need to tolerate some uncomfortable stuff because that’s an inevitable part of acting profession.</p>

<b><p class = "mov">What is something movies always get wrong?</b></p>
<p>First of all, no companies give a job by just looking at the the CV. Yes, that's a good reason but no recruiter listens to your heart breaking stories.Their hearts can't be melted by telling emotional stories. Secondly no company gives a job to rusticated students. After hearing this, no recruiters will show interest in you. Last but not the least, hearing such attitude from a candidate will result in kicking him off without listening to him any further.</p>

<b><p class = "mov">How does one differentiate between "good" and "bad" acting?</b></p>
<p>Look at the eyes. They speak a lot. A good actor makes the fullest use of his eyes to leave a message. A bad actor on the contrary doesn’t utilise them to the fullest.</p>
