<b><p class="para">What happens if you don�t tip your waiter in the U.S.?</p></b>
<p>I once went to a restaurant with my fiance. The waitress was obviously flirting with him and flashing her cleavage every time she bent down. Little did she know I was the one who was going to pay because it was my fianc�s birthday.

I didn�t say anything because I was afraid she would spit in my food or drink. When we left, I wrote a note telling her I wasn�t happy about her obvious flirting. I left her no tip. She posted it on Facebook. I saw it, but never said anything about it because they blocked out my name.</p>

<b><p class="para">What is the purpose of the bread that restaurants give you before they take your order?</p></b>
<p>Here's a secret from my time as a server: bread has a very specific and very manipulative purpose.

At an Italian restaurant I worked at, we had to have the bread at the table within two minutes of their arrival. We had to calculate the amount (one loaf per three people), brush them with oil and sprinkle them with salt.</p>

<div class = "restaurants3">
<b><p class="para">What should you never do in a restaurant?</p></b>
<p>These are based on some of the things I�ve personally seen people do.</p>
<p>1. Don�t wear sunglasses during the whole meal (unless of course, you need to for medical reasons or whatnot.) I can�t tell if you�re talking to me or someone else at the table.</p>
<p>2. Don�t put chewed gum onto your plate and leave it there. I�m happy to bring you a paper napkin.</p>
<p>3. Don�t snap or whistle at waitstaff, we�re people, not dogs.</p>
<p>4. Don�t make dumb jokes if I ask if you need anything else; the polite thing is to say what you need or no thank you. I�ve heard �yeah a million dollars� so many times, when I hear it I want to vomit. I�m here to make sure you have everything you need, not force myself to laugh at things that simply aren�t funny.</p>

<div class = "restaurants4">
<b><p class="para">What do high-end restaurants do if a credit card is declined at the end of a meal?</p></b>
<p>I recall one New Year�s Eve, my wife and I went out with her parents to Ruth�s Chris for dinner. When the bill came, I gave the server my AMEX card and engaged in conversation with my family until he returned.

Little did I know, but AMEX flagged my attempt to charge this expensive meal as possible fraudulent activity, and thus declined the transaction.

When the server returned to my table, I remember him handing me the little black credit card and bill holder and then stepping away slightly as he waited for me to open up the bill holder. At first, I was thinking to myself, why is this guy just standing there? They usually walk away and tend to other tables, you sign the credit card receipt and you're done. Not this time. When I opened up the credit card holder, there was simply a handwritten note that read �I�m very sorry Mr. Shelton, but your credit card has been declined. Perhaps you have another form of payment?�

I was shocked, but really appreciated this technique. Rather than announce to my table and having the neighboring tables overhear an uncomfortable situation, this allowed me to simply switch out the cards and hand it back to the server without any embarrassment.</p></div>

<b><p class="para">How can Zomato gold provide 1+1 on food and 2+2 on drinks while still remaining profitable? Who bears the cost of the free food, Zomato or the restaurant partner?</p></b>
<p>I really wanted to answer this question because a lot of quorans has already asked me for the same. So,I am going to share my two cents on how Zomato gold actually works & how it is profitable for the restaurants.

First of all,Zomato gold is one of the sought after products for the customers where a customer can get 1+1 on food or 2+2 on drinks ( IMFL or Imported ) on any partnered restaurants all over India.

I am an ex-employee of Zomato but still wants to share my restaurant economics of a particular restaurant. Technically,the restaurants bear the cost of free food but since Zomato gold focusses on volume of customers into restaurants,they cover their cost through out.</p>
