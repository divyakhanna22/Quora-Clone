<p>You have to push a button to cross the street.</p>
<p>The entire country will be covered in freezing cold and I’ll still see some people wearing shorts (they don’t feel cold they say!).</p>
<p>The right side drive system.</p>
<p>Everything is taken care of and is well organized - now I know what a “developed nation” means, may be.</p>
<p>You can choose the subjects you actually want to study.</p>
<p>Students have a lot of privileges.</p>
<p>When a school bus stops, everything comes to a standstill.</p>
<p>You can eat food in classes and no one is going to punish you for that.</p>
<p>They don’t take attendance in most of the classes at school. You pay such high fee, you naturally want to attend those classes!</p>
<p>Oh, Colleges are referred to as school very commonly here.</p>
<p>College life is a lot better here.</p>
<p>You can get on-campus jobs if you are a student.</p>

<b><p class = "trav">What is the biggest culture shock you have ever faced?</b></p>
<p>The French don't have locks on the bathroom door.

Yes. You read that right.

The first time I visited France was last May. I was going to be there for a month training with a football academy and since it was just a month, they decided the best option was for me to stay with a host family.

It would be a good experience for both parties and it would be easier as their daughter who is a year older plays for the club as well.

So on my first day, I was just getting to know the family and was figuring out how things work in their house.

At around 6 pm i realize i needed to take a shower and proceed to ask Lucy* ( She was sharing her room with me).

She lead me to the Salle de bain and explained how the tap works.

I told her i should be fine. She smiled and left.

I then closed the door and was looking for a way lock it but didn't find anything. I was pretty sure I'd made a mistake and there was some cool technology for a lock that I probably didn't know about.

So I went looking for Lucy and in my broken French asked her about the lock. She didn't understand, so we went back to the Bathroom after using Google Translate and hand gestures, I asked about the lock.

She started laughing and said, “ Oh we don't use a lock . It's for safety.”

I was stunned.

After seeing my expression, she added “Don't worry, we won't walk in on you. Just tell us before you go for a shower.”

I nodded and made a mental note, to always inform everyone in the house before I go for a shower. In India we take locks on doors pretty seriously, especially when it's the bathroom door. I can't have my dad walking in on me or anyone else for that fact.

It was uncomfortable at first and I kept looking at the door. I also took a relatively shorter time in the shower.</p>

<b><p class = "trav">What should I absolutely not do when visiting the USA?</b></p>
<p>Don’t get out of your car if you get pulled over by police.

I was pulled over by a police officer while driving in Iowa. It was one week after I had arrived in the USA for the first time. I had accidentally made a minor mistake disobeying a traffic sign. Back home in Australia it’s considered polite to get out of your car and walk over to the police officer’s car and hand him your license* so he doesn’t have to get out of his seat. I wanted to be extra polite so I immediately jumped out of my car and walked towards his car while reaching into my back pocket.

I’m lucky to be alive.

If you come from a gun-free country like the UK or Australia you don’t have any natural instinct for gun culture. You don’t realize that police assume that everyone is armed.

Things got immediately serious. The police officer’s hand went to his weapon and I responded by dropping to my knees with my hands up. He yelled a bunch of things at me but my memory is vague because my heartbeat was suddenly pulsing in my ears blotting out all sound. I don’t know if he drew his weapon or not. I was staring intently at the ground, shaking and trying to project non-threatening vibes. My next memory is that there were three police cars around me and a bunch of cops who’d been called for backup. They were all keeping their hands close to their guns. After some time passed (a minute? 30 minutes? I have no idea) the tensions de-escalated and they told me to get up. I gave the officer my license and tried to explain why I’d approached him. It was completely incomprehensible to him that there was a place where people don’t fear cops and vice versa at traffic stops. It was as though I was trying to tell him that I came from Narnia and our cops were all talking animals.</p>

<b><p class = "trav">Is Pondicherry safe for men?</b></p>
<p>No! Not at all. Really regret for going with my girlfriend to pondy. We stayed in accord (No issues with the hotel) and we planned to take a walk along with the roadside, After minutes of walking there were some local guys who came to us and demanded ransom money of Rs. 2000 for a festival. I simply denied and walked away and they followed us till we reach the hotel back. All of a sudden we canceled our trip for 5 days and we went back to our native.</p>

<b><p class = "trav">What are some travel hacks no one talks about?</b></p>
<p>Well surprisingly many people are not Aware about this. I always use this hack whenever I travel on aisle seats. So there is a small button below the arm rest of the aisle seat which you can press to lift it up. Pretty comfortable when you want to get up or just want some more room. The button is located just towards the back end beneath the arm rest.

2. Before traveling anywhere, Search for travel packages online but NEVER Book them. So what to do then?

Browse through the packages and make a note of places of interest and then draft your own itinerary. This excercise would probably take 30 mins but could save you a lot of money! Many a time there are Alot of places or activities in the packages that won't interest you. You could skip those if you are creating a manual one. Also I have found out that if the same travel package you book manually and individually, it's generally much cheaper.

3. Get your communication skills to work : Call the hotel to see if they can Give you a discount. They generally oblige and this way you tend to get more discounts than the one listed on websites and apps!

4. Redundant info but quite useful : While traveling, always wear a shirt /t-shirt with a front pocket. Quite handy to keep your earphones, boarding pass, passport etc. I always make it a point to follow this!</p>
