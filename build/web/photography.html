<b><p class = "photo">Why do I look good in the mirror but bad in photos?</b></p>
<p>Quite simply, your face is the wrong way round.

As a portrait photographer, I've found about 90% of people will say they hate having their photo taken and are the least photogenic person in their family (if not the world).

What I discovered was when I flip the image of someone on my computer, most people prefer it.

We have spent our lives seeing our faces in the mirror, and we have become used to seeing our face that way round. So when we reverse that image, it doesn't look right. 

No one has a perfectly symmetrical  face.

Most people part their hair on one side rather than the other.
Most people have one eye slightly larger than the other.
Most people have one curvier eyebrow and one straighter or pointier.
Most people smile slightly more out of one side of their mouth than the other.
Most people have a mole, scar or facial feature on one side and not the other.

And so it goes on.

So if your nose goes 2mm to the left, then when your image is the other way round it appears to be 4mm to the right of where you're expecting it to be.</p>

<p class = "photo">As a photographer, what made you most uncomfortable when a model/customer took off their clothes?</p>
<b><p>When working with professional boudoir/nude art models everything goes very smooth.

They are used to stand in front of the camera that way: it becomes routine for them.

Their confidence by itself makes the photographer feel comfortable.

I feel uncomfortable every time there is a tense situation between me and the model, a lack of feeling basically.

It happened with normal people not used to pose, at all, let alone with no clothes; in particular when the model is a woman and the photographer is a man (basically 99% of my shooting scenario).

To avoid this it’s important to build a trusted and relaxed atmosphere, hard task if you don’t know who’s standing in front of you.

For this reason it’s useful to have a chat before the shooting, in order to get to know your model.

All personalities are different: what makes comfortable “A” could make uncomfortable “B”.

By spending a couple hours chatting you can understand if they’re more at ease with funny people who make jokes all the time, with more reserved and silent people, etc.

This way it’s easier to make them feel comfortable, because you’ll know how to act with them.

Either way, when I work I make sure to avoid any kind of creepy comment about their body and I always keep my distance, unless I need to get close for a particular shot.

Well, this should be obvious, but I heard the opposite happening too many times so it deserves a mention.</p>
