<b><p class = "cook">How do restaurants make scrambled eggs taste better than homemade?</b></p>
<p>This answer is a re-run, but it’s perfect for this. I used to cook breakfast at a five-star hotel, and when it comes to eggs, I do not fuck around.

The correct way to scramble eggs involves 3 ingredients, 4 tools, a plate, and an oven.

You need:

Eggs (three per person, minimum)

Butter and salt

A bowl

A table fork

A nonstick skillet (commonly called an egg pan)

A red-handled heat-proof Rubbermaid spatula

A stove, with the oven turned to 225

A heatproof plate

To do it:

Crack two thirds of the eggs into a bowl. Using your bare hand as a strainer, separate the rest of the eggs, placing the yolks in the bowl. (Save the whites for the poor sap that wants an egg white omelet.) Beat the eggs GENTLY with the fork. You aren’t trying to whip them, aeration will make them spongy and dry. You just want to break the yolks and incorporate them with the whites.

Add a pinch of salt. Not too much, you can add more later.

Place the plate into the warm oven. (Eggs cool quickly, so this is such an important step.)

Place the pan on gentle heat. Add enough butter to the pan that it melts and coats the bottom. Butter is a natural choice because it tastes good, but also, because you can tell by looking if it is getting too hot. If the bubbles slow down and it starts to brown, back off.

Drop the eggs into the pan and immediately back the heat off. Stir, scraping the bottom constantly, and letting curds form. They should cook relatively slowly (like, a minute, not 10 seconds, for 3 eggs). Add another knob of butter when they look about half cooked.

Turn the heat off when they appear to be almost cooked, but still shiny. They will keep cooking as you get them onto the plate. Check the seasoning, and drop them onto the warm plate. If they aren’t rich and custardy, or if they are dry or brown, you have overcooked them. If you can’t pick them up with a fork, you have undercooked them. Eggs are cheap and this all took 3 minutes, so try again. Repeat until you have fantastic scrambled eggs, because anything less than fantastic is not worth it when the ingredients are this cheap.</p>

<b><p class = "cook">Why do restaurant curry dishes taste better than home made curry?</b></p>
<p>There are many reasons for that:

The restaurants never make separate curry for each dish. They have 3 to 5 basic gravies made which are mostly 1. Red gravy/makhni gravy 2. Brown gravy 3. White gravy. These gravies are made with lots of complex flavor to add richness to the gravy. White gravy is typically use cashews, magaj bee and poppy seeds. These all items give richness to gravy. They also use many spices to make it very flavorfull. Also they fry these gravies in lots n lots of oil and cheap butter/dalda, which further enhances the taste.
Secondly, they use flavor enhancers such as Mono Sodium Glutamate or MSG or versions of it. This is also called as chinese salt and gives extreme umami taste to the food. All ready to eat snacks use these to enhance taste. Mins you, overuse of these can be hazardous to health.
They also cook food on high heat, which further enhances the flavor. As curries are kept in fridge for 4 to 5 days, spices really get mixed well.
These are some of the tricks employed by restaurants to enhance the flavor of curry. Use of too much oil and MSG is bad for your health so it's good to eat them once in while only. Also the chefs and cooks are trained to create perfect mix of spices which normally common people lack.</p>

<b><p class = "cook">Why is pasta cheap to make but expensive at the restaurants? What is the history behind this?</b></p>
<p>My first catering teacher told me the most important thing that non-food service folk will never understand.

“You are the most expensive ingredient here.”

Pasta is cheap. Keeping a human being on site for 8 hours to watch that pot boil while cooking 0.25 dollars worth of pasta costs money.

Rent on the building, keeping glassware, and flatware, and plates and pots and pans ready for service, washing, drying, stacking, then making place settings and providing cutting boards and chef's aprons, and oh my god I could do this all night, but I won’t.

You pay 3.00 dollars for a pound of pasta. A restaurant hires 10 or 15 or 50 human workers to get your pasta to you, on time, on a clean plate, next to clean glassware and flatware and, well, you get the idea. The cost of making pasta at home is minimal. Getting and keeping a restaurant open on the off chance that you show up on a Wednesday night looking for carbonara is expensive.

Do you think you are overpaid at your job? Well, think about restaurant folk making food for 500 people a day. Their job is just as important as yours. They are feeding you. Don’t make the mistake of believing the cost of a pound of spaghetti is the same as serving you the carbonara at the restaurant.</p>

<b><p class = "cook">How does an expensive burger taste compared to a really cheap one?</b></p>
<p>A wealthy friend of mine once begged me to try the famed 777 burger at Le Burger Brasserie for $777 with him and was offering to pay. I felt a little uneasy when I saw the pricing, but he reassured me since he knows it’s out of my price range and told me he really felt indebted to me, so I accepted. I didn’t regret it, but I felt guilty with every bite. The burger was made with a classic sesame seed bun with Kobe beef, Maine lobster, foie gras, caramelized onions, prosciutto and Brie on top of aged balsamic vinegar. Every bite was teeming with flavour. Topped with Dom Pérignon, that pushes the price to the lucky 777 and appeals to superstitious casino high-rollers in Las Vegas.

It was definitely an out-of-this-world experience and I felt luckier after eating it, but I would never blow that sort of money on a burger out of my own pocket, even if I had the money.</p>

<b><p class = "cook">What are the dirty little secrets about working in the food and restaurant industry?</b></p>
<p>I worked at 5 branches of a giant fast food chain famous for selling fried chickens and uses its founder’s face as symbol and the founder was given a title similar to a military rank by his native state in the US.

All 5 restaurants belonged to the same franchisee and the franchisee claims to be the biggest franchisee of the parent company of the restaurant and also runs their other brands which sell pizza and mexican food.

Following is what I saw in ALL 5 restaurants and is common throughout the restaurants, atleast which are run by the same franchisee:

<p>The don’t care for expiry dates of raw chicken and still fried them and sold them days past their used by dates.</p>
<p>Store managers regularly bought cheap chicken drumsticks from local supermarket and sold them along with company provided chicken, coated in the same breading and fried together. All the extra sale went into the pocket of the manager as a lot of the sale is not recorded on registers. Most people don’t ask for receipts.</p>
<p>Say they have a stock of 100 pieces of raw chicken. They would sell 120 pieces (20 extra from the supermarket) but only record 90 on the register and show 10 as wastage. The money from the extra 30 goes to the manager. They would occasionally their “profits” with workers who will take orders without recording them on the registers.</p>
<p>The profits which the manager made this way are to be shared with the area manager. This is a organised racket and happens with all stores. So if there are 10 stores under 1 area manager, they would weekly collect their share from the managers of all 10 stores.</p>
<p>The managers make a killing this way. They all spend it on luxury cars, down payment on houses and other expensive stuff. Two of the managers collected so much cash that they opened their own fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>The parent company has a thing called “mystery shopper” where they send someone to pretends to be a regular shopper and reports on everything from service to food quality etc. This is a way of quality control by the company. If a store get 100% score, the company (franchisee, not the parent company) gives a cash reward to the store manager. There is another racket here. Store manager know which company conducts the mystery shopping. They have made their friends and friends of other workers in the store to register with that company and try to bag the assignment of their particular stores. Then they give them a score of 100%. The manager then shares that cash reward with the “mystery-shopper”. Company thinks that the store is functioning rally well.</p>
<p>The oil used for frying is not cleaned regularly and changed infrequently, against the regulations of the parent company. The day oil is changed, the taste is totally different. As the oil gets dirtier, there is a marked difference in the taste, color and quality of the food. Most people don’t notice that as the condiments, side dishes, soda, fries etc mask the taste.</p>
<p>So basically, the food is not always what is advertised, can be spoiled, bought from the local supermarket, dirty. And store managers and area managers make a killing amount of illegal cash. And the parent company has no clue what’s going on. (Maybe they do and are also accomplice, and money also goes further up the chain, but I didn’t notice that)</p>
