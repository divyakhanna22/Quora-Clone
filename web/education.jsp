<b><p class = "edu">What is the coolest excuse for being late to class?</b></p>
<p>In my second year of engineering, there was a very strict professor. He was very punctual and used to insult latecomers very badly. He had strictly instructed us to either come on time or to not come at all.

One day we had to submit our assignment to him but my friend was late. Since that was the last day to submit the assignment, she couldn't skip the class. She gathered all her courage and asked the professor if she could come in.

<p>Friend: May I come in sir?</p>

He looked at her as if she had committed a sin or eaten his whole pizza.

<p>Professor: Since you know latecomers are not allowed in my lecture and yet you have dared to ask me, I hope you have a good reason or else you are in big trouble.</p>

<p>Friend: A guy hit my Activa and I had fight with him.</p>

<p>Professor: So, what do I do? That must be your fault. If you girls give right indicator and then turn left, what can a guy do?</p>

<p>Friend: Sir, this is exactly what happened.

Professor seemed extremly happy and puzzled at the same time coz his prediction was right but why did she accept it at once?</p>

<p>Professor: See. I knew it.</p>

<p>Friend: Umm…sir you have misunderstood a bit. I mean I gave right indicator and turned right only. But the guy still hit me. When I asked him about it, he had a similar reason like yours. He also thought that I would turn left after giving right indicator so he didn't slow down. So, I had a fight with him.</p>

<p>The whole class burst into laughter. Professor also had smile on his face. He couldn't believe what just happened and she got permission to get into the class.

That was one of the coolest excuses I ever witnessed to get into the class.</p>

<b><p class = "edu">As a teacher, how do you feel when students start laughing in a classroom?</b></p>
<p>During a sex-ed session I once asked students to comment on the risk of condoms splitting. “It depends,” one student shouted out. It was uncharacteristically thoughtful sounding for this student, so I was keen to follow it up. “On what?” I asked.

“Whether you’ve got a big jumbo,” he said. Everyone laughed except me. I was annoyed, because he’d set me up, but as a teacher there was a case that I should challenge him for trivialising an important issue.

It’s easy to feel like a chump when students laugh, which I guess is how I felt that time. Other times, like when I accidentally walk backwards into a trolley while explaining something, it’s easier to laugh at yourself. And obviously if you’ve cracked a joke, it’s a wonderful feeling when the students laugh.

Basically it depends on your relationship with the students and the class as a whole. Some students will enjoy a bad natured laugh at the teacher’s expense and that doesn’t feel great. It especially makes you question whether you the teacher are guilty of teaching the class in an alienating way, which can be difficult to avoid when you have to force students to learn difficult things they’re not naturally interested in.

What’s really nice is when everyone can enjoy a genuine laugh together. I had a student who liked to crack a lot of jokes. “Do you like chimney jokes, Sir? I’ve got stacks of them. Next one’s on the house,” he’d say. One time he asked my permission to tell a joke, which concerned me. “As long as it’s clean,” I said. “Only tell a joke you’d be happy to tell your granny.”

“My granny’s worse than me,” he replied. All of us laughed.</p>

<b><p class = "edu">What does Zomato give its employees on their first day of work?</b></p>
<p>First day is mostly spent on paperwork, but the second day is interesting, A few fortunate ones like me got learning sessions from important team (web, infra, security) leads and gunjan (CTO), but most probably these learning sessions may not happen for all, it completely depends on team leads availability.

third day you would be allocated a team and a bunch of bugs/tasks, most of the awesome people I have met at zomato would allow you to start solving the tasks and problems in your own way and provide feedback and guidance during the PR merge time unless you specifically ask for guidance during the task.</p>

<b><p class = "edu">What are 10 life hacks every college student should know?</b></p>
<p>1. If you actually read the material, you learn it a whole lot better.

Seriously.

You think I'm joking, but as someone who constantly did the bare minimum (and struggled as a result), it took me a long time to realize that if you just take the time to read the book (read and underline as you go), you learn it.

Shocking, right?

The biggest difference I saw in my own personal education happened as soon as I made the shift from reading as a task to reading as a conduit for knowledge.

You can't just let your eyes glaze over and assume the words will stick.

You have to read like you picked this book up on purpose, and there's something in it you want to find for yourself.</p>

<p>2. If you struggle to pay attention, sit in the front row.

I was never a great student. But somewhere along the line, in college, I admitted this to myself and started making decisions accordingly.

I had to take math and science classes in order to graduate, and I knew if I sat in the back row I would doze off, write raps in my notebook, or find a way to cause trouble and be disruptive.

So, I forced myself to sit in the front row.

I put myself in a position where it would become embarrassingly obvious if I didn't know the material.

I'm a competitive person. I thrived off the fear of looking stupid.

And got A's in both classes as a result.</p>

<p>3. Start studying more than the night before.

Expert-level procrastinator here.

I'm telling you, if you do even ten minutes of studying a week in advance, six days in advance, five days, four days, three days, two days, by the time the test rolls around, you'll crush it.

This is just how memory works.

And it doesn't take much, really.

But the information needs time to marinate.

In a metaphor, if the steak requires eight hours of marinating, you can't force that process to happen in an hour. You just can't.

Let it marinate.</p>

<p>4. Spend time around people you want to be like.

If everyone experienced the academic demands of college in isolation, they would pass with flying colors.

What makes college such a challenge for some people are the distractions: the loud noises down your dorm hall, the parties, your roommate, the list goes on forever.

There is always something to do, and always someone trying to convince you to do it with them.

This same advice goes for anyone out of college and just trying to do well in life, period?-?but it is extremely prominent in those formative college years:

Spend time around people you want to be like.

Spend time around people who have good habits and big goals.

Spend time around people you see yourself learning from, instead of holding their head while they throw up on a Wednesday morning.

Spend time around people who have something, some personality trait (confidence), some skill set (guitar), some quality that you don’t.

Over time, you'll soak it up-and grow as a result.</p>

<p>5. Invest as much time as possible into your own projects.

Trust me, of all the things you can extract from a college experience, the amount of free time you have to work on things that interest you is the greatest hack of all.

Most students go through all of college doing two things:

Getting "good enough" grades to get by.
Socializing.
Very few pursue any ideas of their own.

Very few build something.

Very few spend their nights learning instead of socializing.

Very few decide to start a club, or a new hobby, or a business.

You will never, ever, have as much time as you do in college to invest in yourself.

But the more time you do invest in the things you’re interested in, skills you want to acquire, the farther along you will be than every other 20-something when you enter the real world.

And that's the greatest hack of all.</p>

<b><p class = "edu">What can teachers do to stop students from sleeping during class?</b></p>
<p>I had a teacher in high school who saw students fall asleep, and left them alone. He let them sleep and he continued on with the class, with those students who were awake and ready to learn.

He held no grudges.

He did not judge.

He knew that if a student fell asleep in his class, it was because they were struggling. Because they were either taking a medication for their anxiety or depression which made them sleepy, or they stayed up studying all night, or perhaps even playing games, but either way, he did not take away from them what was their choice: to participate or to sleep.

The truth is, nobody ever wanted to sleep in his class because it was simply too interesting. He engaged students with the material, told stories, had a great sense of humor, and brought up interesting and profound topics.

Nobody wanted to miss out on his class, instead, most students looked forward to it, so when someone fell asleep, everyone understood that there was an underlying issue, and that teacher took note of it.

I think that ultimately, this choice of participating or sleeping should be left to the student.

Teachers don’t know half of what goes on in the student’s life, and instead of waking that student up, perhaps they should try their best to engage that student with the material in the first place.</p>
